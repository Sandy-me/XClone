# XClone
XClone is a lightweight proof-of-concept clone of Twitter (now X), built using the Vaadin (https://vaadin.com/) Java framework. It showcases a clean, mobile-friendly UI, post interactivity (likes, retweets, replies), and a nested commenting systemâ€”all without requiring backend integration.
